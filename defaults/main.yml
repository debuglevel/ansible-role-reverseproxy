# ACME endpoints to get automatically SSL certificates from.

# The default is ZeroSSL, because their limits are higher than Let's Encrypt:

reverse_proxy__acme_endpoint: https://acme.zerossl.com/v2/DV90
# reverse_proxy__acme_endpoint: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

# If you want to use Let's Encrypt, consider using the staging endpoint for testing:

# reverse_proxy__caddy_autohttps: "off"  # Disables both certificate automation and HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects.
# reverse_proxy__caddy_autohttps: "disable_redirects"  # Disable only HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects.
# reverse_proxy__caddy_autohttps: "disable_certs"  # Disable only certificate automation.
# reverse_proxy__caddy_autohttps: "ignore_loaded_certs"  # Automate certificates even for names which appear on manually-loaded certificates. Useful if you specified a certificate using the tls directive which contains names (or wildcards) that you instead want to be managed automatically.
